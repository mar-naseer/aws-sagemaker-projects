🌟 My Learning Journey with AWS SageMaker 🌟
As a student passionate about AI, ML, and Data Science, I always wondered how companies take models from just code on a laptop to production-level solutions used in the real world and various applications.


So Finally, I have successfully finished the "Practical AWS SageMaker – 6 Real World Case Studies" course by Dr. Ryan Ahmed on Udemy online 🎓
This was my first complete journey into Cloud + Machine Learning, and it has been eye-opening to see how AWS enables us to take models beyond Jupyter notebooks into real-world, scalable deployments.
Throughout the course, I worked on 6 hands-on projects covering:

 ✅ Linear & Multiple Regression (Salary + Medical Insurance Prediction)
 
 ✅ XGBoost Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning (Retail Store Sales Forecasting)
 
 ✅ Dimensionality Reduction with PCA + XGBoost Classification (Cardiovascular Disease Prediction)
 
 ✅ Deep Learning with CNN (Traffic Sign Classification – LeNet Architecture)
 
 ✅ SageMaker Studio, AutoML & Debugging Tools.
 

Each project pushed me to connect what I had studied in my B.E. CSE (AIML) with AWS Cloud technologies (EC2, S3, Marketplace, AWS Studio) — moving from just “theory” to scalable, deployable solutions.
📂 Next Steps
 In the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing one of many project’s deployment on my GitHub repo's  along with the learning journey, challenges, and takeaways from each case study.
This way, anyone following along can see not just the certificate, but the actual implementation & results behind it. 🚀
