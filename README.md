ðŸŒŸ My Learning Journey with AWS SageMaker ðŸŒŸ
As a student passionate about AI, ML, and Data Science, I always wondered how companies take models from just code on a laptop to production-level solutions used in the real world.

To bridge that gap, I recently started a hands-on course on AWS SageMaker by Dr. Ryan Ahmed on Udemy Learning and it has been a game-changer, & lots of real learning

Through this journey, Iâ€™ve not only strengthened my ML fundamentals but also learned the practical side of #Cloud deployment â€” managing endpoints, scaling resources, and yes, even learning from unexpected billing surprises ðŸ˜….
ðŸ’¡ One big takeaway: Machine Learning isnâ€™t just about building models â€” itâ€™s about efficiently deploying, optimizing, and monitoring them in real-world environments.

This is just the beginning of my cloud ML journey ðŸš€ and Iâ€™m excited to explore more in the AI/ML space.
