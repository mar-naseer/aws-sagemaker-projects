🌟 My Learning Journey with AWS SageMaker 🌟
As a student passionate about AI, ML, and Data Science, I always wondered how companies take models from just code on a laptop to production-level solutions used in the real world.

To bridge that gap, I recently started a hands-on course on AWS SageMaker by Dr. Ryan Ahmed on Udemy Learning and it has been a game-changer.
So far, I’ve built and deployed:
📊 A salary prediction model using Linear Regression
🏥 An insurance premium prediction model
🛒 A retail sales forecasting model using XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning

Through this journey, I’ve not only strengthened my ML fundamentals but also learned the practical side of hashtag#Cloud deployment — managing endpoints, scaling resources, and yes, even learning from unexpected billing surprises 😅.
💡 One big takeaway: Machine Learning isn’t just about building models — it’s about efficiently deploying, optimizing, and monitoring them in real-world environments.
I’ll be sharing short posts on each project in the coming weeks, including:
 🔹 PCA for dimensionality reduction
 🔹 Cardiovascular disease classification
 🔹 Image classification with TensorFlow on SageMaker
This is just the beginning of my cloud ML journey 🚀 and I’m excited to explore more in the AI/ML space.
